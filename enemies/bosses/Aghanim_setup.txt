Boss Aghaninim needs the script Aghanim.z and the script Lightning.z to work propely.
Tiles is on page 185 in the test file for Aghanim.
There is some Weapons/Misc sprites that also need to be setuped also like 
Sprite 105 = Ball After image

Combos 20436 - 20463
are for Aghanim as well.

The setup is not easy so i wish some one could write a more proper setup.txt
for it.I had to trace everything in the scripts to see what does what.

To figure out how it works.
And one more thing fill the room with flags 99 on the floor otherwise it will not spawn at
all.

Play the test file take the red portal in the file and go north couple rooms to 
face Aghanim.

Sorry about my very bad english
